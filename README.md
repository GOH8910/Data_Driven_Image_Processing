# üìä Data-Driven Image Processing

This repository contains my work and experiments in data-driven image processing using deep learning. It includes projects focused on medical image registration, segmentation, and restoration.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `Registration/` ‚Äì Image registration using models like VoxelMorph
- `Segmentation/` ‚Äì Deep learning-based medical image segmentation (e.g. U-Net)
- `Restoration/` ‚Äì Image restoration and enhancement tasks
- `utils/` ‚Äì Utility scripts and helpers for preprocessing, metrics, and training

## üöÄ Goals

- Learn and apply data-driven approaches to medical imaging
- Implement and evaluate models such as U-Net and VoxelMorph
- Explore segmentation masks, image alignment, and reconstruction

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Large dataset files (`.npy`, `.pth`) are excluded from the repository due to GitHub size limits.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Notes

This repository reflects my learning process in applying machine learning to biomedical images. Some components are prototypical or academic in nature.
